Learning Machine Learning Models
1 - ANN
2 - CNN with application in object detection, neural style transfer, etc.
3 - (Bi-directional) RNN, GRU, LSTM with application in NLP
4 - Reinforcement Learning: Multi-armed Bandits, Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, TD Learning (Î»-SARSA), Q Learning, Function Approximation, DQN, Policy Gradient
5 - Generative Models (RNN for word generation, stable diffusion, etc.)
